Notes

This project is about the creation of a model for helping users to predict car prices. The dataset was obtained from this kaggle competition 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset.
the data used is also uploaded on the same directory .

Project plan:

    Prepare data and Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    Use linear regression for predicting price
    Understanding the internals of linear regression
    Evaluating the model with RMSE
    Feature engineering
    Regularization
    Using the model
